# NG_VIRUS
NG_VIRUS is very small in the code,but if you run NG_VIRUS on a computer, it will imperceptibly create a lot of txt documents with the word "Hello".If you want to change the document name, just run python and change the word "Hello".Any other word.



i = 1, а True: i + = 1 f = open ("привет" + str (i) + ". txt", "w")
